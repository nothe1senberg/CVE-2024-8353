## üåü Description
CVE-2024-8353
This vulnerability makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. The additional presence of a POP chain allows attackers to delete arbitrary files and achieve remote code execution. This is essentially the same vulnerability as CVE-2024-5932, however, it was discovered the the presence of stripslashes_deep on user_info allows the is_serialized check to be bypassed. 

## Details

2. Navigate to the tool's directory:

```bash
cd CVE-2024-8353
```

3. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Usage

To use the tool, run the script from the command line as follows:

```bash
python exploit.py [options]
```


### Options

- -u, --url:
  Specify the target URL or IP address.

- -f, --file:
  Specify a file containing a list of URLs to scan.

- -t, --threads:
  Set the number of threads for concurrent scanning.

- -o, --output:
  Define an output file to save the scan results.

When a single URL is provided with the -u option and the target is vulnerable, the script will attempt to execute arbitrary code.

### Example

```bash
$ python3 exploit.py -u http://target-url.com
[+] Remote code execution triggered successfully.
[!] http://target-url.com is vulnerable to CVE-2024-8353.
```

## üìä Mass Scanning

For mass scanning, use the -f option with a file containing URLs. The tool will scan each URL and print concise results, indicating whether each target is vulnerable.

```bash
python exploit.py -f urls.txt
```
